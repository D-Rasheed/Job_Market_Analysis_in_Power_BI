# Job_Market_Analysis_in_Power_BI

This repository contains a case study project focused on analyzing job market trends using Microsoft Power BI. The project simulates a real-world scenario for a fictional recruitment company, DataSearch, aimed at uncovering key insights from a job posting dataset.

### Project Overview

- Clean and preprocess a job posting dataset using Power Query.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends in skills, salaries, and job roles.
- Build interactive and insightful dashboards to support business decision-making.

### Key Features

#### Data Cleaning: 
Used Power Query to preprocess job titles, clean up redundant fields, and standardize data for analysis.

#### EDA: 
Conducted analyses on job posting trends, skill demands, salary ranges, and the effect of experience on salaries.

#### DAX Calculations:
 Created calculated measures for salary gauges, top skill trends, and other market insights.

#### Interactive Dashboards: 
Designed Power BI dashboards with bookmarks, filters, and advanced visualizations for user interaction.
